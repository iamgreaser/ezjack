EZJACK: a simple wrapper for JACK to make stuff a bit easier
by Ben "GreaseMonkey" Russell, 2014
See "LICENCE" for the actual licence text (it's MIT).

STATUS: Creates a client and ports and links them up. Does not actually handle audio yet.

TODO:
- Synchronous, streamed ezjack_write()/ezjack_read() calls (supporting deinterleaving)
- Audio format conversion
- Audio resampling
- Callback support (which would ideally use ezjack_write / ezjack_read)
